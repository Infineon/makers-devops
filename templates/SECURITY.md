# Reporting Security Issues

The Electron team and community take security bugs in Electron seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Electron team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## The Electron Security Notification Process

For context on Electron's security notification process, please see the [Notifications](https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md#notifications) section of the Security WG's [Membership and Notifications](https://github.com/electron/governance/blob/main/wg-security/membership-and-notifications.md) Governance document.

## Learning More About Security

To learn more about securing an Electron application, please see the [security tutorial](docs/tutorial/security.md).







# Security Policy

The maintainers of the Moby project take security seriously. If you discover
a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately
to [security@docker.com](mailto:security@docker.com).

Reporter(s) can expect a response within 72 hours, acknowledging the issue was
received.

## Review Process

After receiving the report, an initial triage and technical analysis is
performed to confirm the report and determine its scope. We may request
additional information in this stage of the process.

Once a reviewer has confirmed the relevance of the report, a draft security
advisory will be created on GitHub. The draft advisory will be used to discuss
the issue with maintainers, the reporter(s), and where applicable, other
affected parties under embargo.

If the vulnerability is accepted, a timeline for developing a patch, public
disclosure, and patch release will be determined. If there is an embargo period
on public disclosure before the patch release, the reporter(s) are expected to
participate in the discussion of the timeline and abide by agreed upon dates
for public disclosure.

## Accreditation

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you,
although we will keep your name confidential if you request it. We also like to
send gifts - if you're into swag, make sure to let us know. We do not currently
offer a paid security bounty program at this time.

## Supported Versions

This project uses long-lived branches to maintain releases. Refer to
[BRANCHES-AND-TAGS.md](project/BRANCHES-AND-TAGS.md) in the default branch to
learn about the current maintenance status of each branch.
